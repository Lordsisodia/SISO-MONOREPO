# Academy Feedback — 16 Nov 2025

## Navigation / Shell
- [x] Rename the top sidebar callout title from **“Academy”** to **“Dashboard”** on /partners/academy landing/nav card (screenshot: 16-11-25 academy getting-started callout).

## Getting Started
- [x] Add brand icons to each progress callout (Welcome video, Complete first lesson, Book office hours, etc.) so the checklist tiles match the branded icon style. (screenshot: 16-11-25 academy getting-started steps)
- [x] Note: 0/3 steps indicator and CTA positions are acceptable; no change needed unless icons added above.

## Courses
- [x] Apply the “double callout” pattern (icon + title) to the Search & Filters card and to each course highlight card (Intermediate/Enterprise Sales 101, Advanced Growth Marketing Sprint, Beginner Startup CS Playbook) beneath it. (screenshot: 16-11-25 academy courses)

## Training Spotlight
- [x] Wrap the **Next steps / Preview the lesson plan** block in the double callout pattern and add the icon + title treatment to match other spotlight cards. (screenshot: 16-11-25 academy training-spotlight)
- [x] Note: Other spotlight cards (“Why Now”, “Need-to-know prep”, stats) are fine as-is; double callout not required elsewhere unless design wants consistency.

## Portfolio Route
- [x] Fix routing so `/partners/academy/portfolio` loads the actual Portfolio page instead of redirecting to the training hub. Flagged as higher-risk (existing app code already built); handle carefully to avoid regressions.

## Pitch Kit
- [x] Add icons/dividers per double callout pattern to the **Bundles / Recommended combos** header and to **Needs support** section; ensure headings use icon + title style. (screenshots: 16-11-25 academy pitch-kit)
- [x] Reduce the footprint of the **Message Partner Success** button; it currently dominates the “Need support?” block. Consider right-aligning or using a secondary/ghost style.

## General Style Notes
- [x] Where double callouts are added, verify they use the standard icon + title + subtle divider treatment for consistency.
- [x] Preserve current “sexy” cards (e.g., “Why Now”) where called out; only apply double callouts where explicitly flagged above.

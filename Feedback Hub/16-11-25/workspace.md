# Workspace

- **Calendar**: UI/UX acceptable; no immediate changes requested.
- **Tasks**: Plan to swap in SISO-INTERNAL tasks UI (boards + filters + bulk actions). Capture any extra needs before the migration.
- **Files**: My Files route was 500'ing; rebuilt as server page with cards + Lucide icons. Verify loads at `/partners/workspace/files` and confirm upload/scroll CTA behavior once real actions are wired.

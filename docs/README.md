# SISO Monorepo Documentation

All reference material now lives under three top-level umbrellas so every team knows where to look:

| Scope | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client portal | `docs/client/` | Product specs, integrations, BMAD notes, and PDR artifacts for the client-base experience. |
| Partner portal | `docs/partners/` | Everything partnership-focused: architecture, feedback hubs, performance baselines, PDR decks, BMAD workflows, sprint outputs. |
| Shared | `docs/shared/` | Cross-portal guidance (architecture core, migration plans, integrations index, BMAD philosophy, PDR methodologies) plus legacy references. |

### Pointers
- Legacy structure and onboarding guides are under `docs/shared/architecture/legacy/`.
- Historical partner architecture audits sit in `docs/partners/archive/architecture/`.
- The shared PDR cookbook (methodology, toolkit, delivery, research) lives in `docs/shared/pdr-cookbook/` with archives inside `.../archive/`.
- Sprint and workflow status outputs generated by BMAD land in `docs/partners/` (see `docs/partners/bmad/README.md`).

When adding new material, drop it under the relevant portal. If it applies to both, place it in `docs/shared/` and link from the portal README so duplication stays low.

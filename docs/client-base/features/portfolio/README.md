# Client Portfolio Feature Pack

Structured workspace for everything related to the portfolio experience inside `apps/client`.

## Folder map

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `planning/` | Source docs such as the project brief, PRD, and master plan. |
| `architecture-docs/` | Technical specs (overall architecture, domain map, client-detail spec). |
| `status/` | Delivery checkpoints (implementation status, ready-to-use guide, complete summary). |
| `epics/` | High-level objectives that feed planning (e.g., EPIC-001). |
| `stories/` | Ready-to-build BMAD stories (001.001+, etc.). |
| `ux/` | Visual exploration, heuristics, UX specs. |

Add new material to the appropriate folder so future contributors (or AI agents) can jump straight to the content they need.

# Portfolio Architecture Docs

Technical references for the portfolio domain:

- `portfolio-enhancement-architecture.md` – overall technical plan
- `portfolio-enhancement-DOMAIN-ARCHITECTURE.md` – domain-driven map
- `portfolio-client-detail-spec.md` – detailed spec for the client detail page

Add future architecture updates (e.g., ADRs, new module specs) here so engineering always knows the latest structure.

# Client App Integrations

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `auth/` | `clerk-client-setup.md` – how to wire Clerk → Supabase (env vars, webhooks, migrations). |
| `media/` | Cloudinary setup/API guides plus the image workflow doc for portfolio assets. |
| `mcp/` | MCP configuration + setup instructions (Supabase schema, verification script). |

Update these guides whenever keys, schemas, or external services change so the client-base app stays deployable.

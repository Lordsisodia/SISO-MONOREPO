# Landing Page Playbooks

Each Markdown file here describes copy, components, and conversion tactics for a single industry (e.g., `coffee-shops-cafes.md`). Files are named using kebab-case versions of the industry names.

Guidelines:
- One file per industry vertical.
- Keep naming consistent (`restaurants-food-service.md`, `digital-marketing-agencies.md`, etc.).
- If you introduce a new vertical, add it to this folder and mention it in related planning docs.

This directory was flattened in 2025-11 so there are no nested category folders—search by filename to jump to the industry you need.

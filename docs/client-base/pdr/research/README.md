# Research Directory

PDR research is now organized into six categories:

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `market/` | Market gaps, intelligence repositories, strategic briefs, international analyses. |
| `competitors/` | Competitor breakdowns, partnership/talent protection studies, competitive response strategy. |
| `pricing/` | Pricing models and strategies (AI agency pricing, hybrid/project-only, payment options, maintenance, ultra-think pricing). |
| `partner-program/` | Partner tiering, training, recruitment, legal frameworks, resource delivery/support systems. |
| `product-ux/` | Partner portal technical specs, UI/UX patterns, marketing asset guidelines. |
| `customer-insights/` | Deep dives into customer feedback data. |

Add new research to the appropriate folder and avoid reintroducing `research--*.md` duplicates.

# Task Library

This workspace stores all implementation tasks for the client app:

- `core-roadmap/` – execution order and dependencies for every task.
- `master/` – sprint packs (`MASTER-TASK-LIST.md`, `task-summary-index.md`, week-by-week guides, and the AI task assignment template).
- `tasks/` – numbered implementation guides (`01-quick-client-onboarding.md` through `14-live-build-development.md` plus attachments).

Start with `core-roadmap/README.md` to understand sequencing, then dive into the sprint pack or the specific `tasks/NN-*.md` file for execution details.

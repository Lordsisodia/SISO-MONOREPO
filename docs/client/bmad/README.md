# BMAD – Client Track (Placeholder)

The BMAD core install (`.bmad/`) is shared across the repo. Use this folder to capture client-portal specific workflow plans once the client track spins up.

## Current status
- No dedicated workflow-status file yet.
- Sprint artifacts currently point to `docs/partners/sprint-artifacts/` via `.bmad/bmm/config.yaml`; update the config when the client track needs its own output path.

## Next steps
1. Run `*workflow-init` with a client-focused scope to generate `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` entries or a separate client tracker.
2. Mirror the structure used in `docs/partners/bmad/` (workflow summaries, status links, sprint policies) when client work begins.

# Progressive Unlock (Client Base)

Docs in this folder capture the try-before-you-commit dashboard concept for the client base app:

- `overview.md` – product narrative and preview/auth strategy.
- `implementation-roadmap.md` – phased rollout plan.
- `domain-structure.md` – expected domain folders and component scaffolding.

If you add new research or specs for this flow, drop them here so everything stays in one place.

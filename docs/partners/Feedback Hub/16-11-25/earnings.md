## Achievements page
- [x] Remove white corner flag behind trophy icon on hero card (no overlay on title).
- [x] Remove leaderboard filter pills (overall/region/industry/newcomers) to reclaim space.
- [x] Add floating nav / burger button so mobile navigation is available.

## Leaderboard
- [x] Fix broken route: added `/partners/earnings/leaderboard` page wired to `EarningsLeaderboardScreen` and updated internal links to this path.

## Open items / follow-up
- [x] Confirmed in code that all references now target `/partners/earnings/leaderboard` (no remaining `/partners/leaderboard` strings). Recommend quick runtime smoke after deploy.

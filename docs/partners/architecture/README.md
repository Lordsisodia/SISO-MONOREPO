# Partners Architecture Track

Architecture-only docs for the partner experience inside the monorepo. Product goals and delivery plans now live under `docs/features/partners/` + `docs/partners/notes/`.

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `architecture.md` | Structural blueprint (domains, state, security, deployment rules). |
| `integration-points.md` | Cross-app contracts and shared package interfaces. |
| `diagrams.md` | Mermaid/visual references kept in sync with the blueprint. |

Legacy “audit” PDFs and multi-hundred-page PRDs have been deleted—use the files above (and `docs/partners/notes/product-vision.md`) for the current source of truth.

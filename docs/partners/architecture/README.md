# Partners Architecture Track

Architecture-only docs for the partner experience inside the monorepo. Product goals and delivery plans now live under `docs/product/partners/`.

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `architecture.md` | Structural blueprint (domains, state, security, deployment rules). |
| `integration-points.md` | Cross-app contracts and shared package interfaces. |
| `diagrams.md` | Mermaid/visual references kept in sync with the blueprint. |

Historic research and long-form planning sit in `../archive/partners/`.

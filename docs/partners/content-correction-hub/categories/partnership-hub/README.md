# Partnership hub

This is meant to be the central “partnership hub” experience, but at the moment the only concrete route that behaves like that dashboard lives inside the client pipeline stack (`/partners/pipeline-ops`). We keep this file so we can capture the broader strategy for the hub (e.g., mission copy, hero CTA, teaser to other categories) while the actual content work happens in `client-pipeline.md`.

Use `../templates/page-template.md` whenever you are drilling into planning-level details.

## Planning focus
- Define what makes the hub distinct from the dashboards that live inside the specific categories (client pipeline, academy, community, etc.).
- Capture any high-level copy or hero requirements (value proposition, modular tiles, navigation) we expect once the dedicated hub page exists.
- Once the actual route materializes, move the detailed page-level notes into `client-pipeline.md` so the questions link directly to the file that needs editing.

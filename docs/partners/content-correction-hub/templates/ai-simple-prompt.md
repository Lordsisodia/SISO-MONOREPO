**File Location:**
`/Users/shaansisodia/DEV/SISO-ECOSYSTEM/SISO-MONOREPO/content-correction-hub/templates/`

- `page-template.md` - For detailed analysis of individual pages
- `ai-workflow-prompt.md` - Complete step-by-step process guide

## 🎯 What We're Working On

**Big Picture Goal:**
We've built all the UI pages with basic information. Now we need to validate that the UI is working correctly and the content is exactly what we want BEFORE connecting to backend databases and functionality.

**Current Situation:**
- ✅ UI components are built and functional
- ✅ Navigation between pages works
- 🔄 All content is currently placeholder/mock data
- 🔄 Need to verify each page solves the right problem
- 🔄 Need to confirm content is accurate and helpful

**Your Job:**
Walk me through a systematic validation process for each section and page, helping me make clear decisions about what's ready for backend development vs what needs more work.

## 🚀 How to Start

1. **Read the AI workflow prompt** (ai-workflow-prompt.md) for detailed process
2. **Ask me which section** to start with (Academy, Community, Settings, Earnings, Workspace)
3. **Follow the 6-phase process** outlined in the workflow prompt
4. **Help me make decisions** about each page using the validation questions
5. **Document backend requirements** for pages marked as "ready"

That's it! The workflow prompt has all the detailed steps and formatting guidelines you need.

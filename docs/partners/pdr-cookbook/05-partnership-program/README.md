# 05 — Partnership Program

Single home for partner-portal strategy:

- `partner-portal-master.md` now bundles the detailed design, audit, and feature breakdown; original fragments moved to `99-archive/partner-portal/` for reference.  
- Core specs: progressive system requirements, research rollups, and partner success docs.  
- `partnership-program/` subfolder: onboarding, legal, gamification, recruitment, sales, and attribution research.  
- Supporting indexes: audit, index, research-complete, sales resources, and task trackers.

If a document targets partners (vs. client portal), place it here and cross-link from other folders as needed.

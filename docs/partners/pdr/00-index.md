# Partner PDR Library

This folder now hosts **all** partner-portal PDR content. The duplicate `pdr-cookbook/` and `PDR-extracted/` folders have been removed—refer back to `docs/PDR-cookbook/05-partnership-program` for the master cookbook, and keep partner-only notes here.

## Folder Map

| Folder | Purpose | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-master-spec/` | Canonical experience specs and audits. | `partner-portal-master.md`, detailed design, page audit, pages breakdown, page mapping. |
| `02-program-blueprints/` | System-level partnership plans. | Program overview, roadmap, progressive flows, technical specs, existing platform analysis. |
| `03-enablement-kits/` | Partner enablement + GTM collateral. | Onboarding checklist, sales guide, recruitment plan, gamification, attribution research. |
| `04-compliance-legal/` | Legal + governance references. | `legal-compliance-guide.md`. |
| `05-research-indexes/` | Indexes, audits, and task trackers. | Partner program index/audit/research summary, sales resources summary, program tasks. |

## How to contribute

1. If the material is universally applicable, update `docs/PDR-cookbook/05-partnership-program` and link back here.  
2. If it is partner-only (migration notes, internal tasks, roadmap decisions), drop it into the numbered folder that matches its purpose.  
3. Avoid adding new standalone copies of files that already live in the cookbook—link to the canonical version instead.

# Monorepo Architecture Decisions (ADR Log)

Use this folder for append-only Architecture Decision Records. Template suggestion:

```
# ADR-YYYYMMDD-short-title
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- **Context:** What problem are we solving?
- **Decision:** Summary of the choice.
- **Consequences:** Trade-offs and follow-up work.
```

Link new ADRs from `docs/architecture/README.md` when they materially change the architecture.

# Shared Playbooks

This folder now mirrors the original PDR cookbook structure so nothing is orphaned:

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `00/` | PDR system overview (system analysis, process flow, implementation roadmap). |
| `01/` | Methodology guides (MEGA processes, AI-orchestration, instant value strategy, real world examples). |
| `02/` | Toolkit (steps, templates, config, guides, testing harnesses). |
| `03/` | Insight packs and deep analysis series (analysis-one/two/three, audits). |
| `04/` | Delivery assets (integration plan, cost models, implementation guides). |
| `06/` | Research intelligence archive. |
| `bmad/` | Shared BMAD principles and IDE workflows. |

Portal-specific playbooks now live under `docs/client-base/` or `docs/partners/` and link back here when they rely on these shared references.

# Shared Operations

Day-to-day platform hygiene lives here.

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `infrastructure/` | Repo-wide onboarding, deployment, and tooling runbooks (add here as they are created). |
| `migration/` | Source of truth for app→domain migration work. Contains `guides/` for canonical instructions and `decisions/` for dated notes. |
| `integrations/` | Index of third-party setup policies that both portals follow (link out to the portal-specific docs when needed). |

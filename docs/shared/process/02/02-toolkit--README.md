# 02 — Toolkit

Reusable assets the delivery teams plug into automations:

- `steps/` — canonical 10-step summaries vs. deep-dive 40-step instructions.  
- `templates/` — markdown/JSON/JS scaffolds for every artifact we emit.  
- `config/` — machine-readable settings such as `master-config.json`.  
- `testing/` — harness + README for validating generated work.  
- `guides/` — narrative docs like the Execution Guide, API blueprint, and automation quick-start.

When adding a new template or helper, document the expected inputs/outputs so AI agents can pick it up without human context.

# Shared Playbooks

This folder now contains every cross-portal delivery artifact in a single place:

- `pdr/` – flattened PDR cookbook + workbench (+ prefixed filenames showing original sections).
  - Includes BMAD principles as `bmad--*.md` files, since BMAD is the foundation of our PDR flow.

Portal-specific workflows should live under `docs/client/` or `docs/partners/` and link back here when they rely on these shared references.

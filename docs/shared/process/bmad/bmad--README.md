# BMAD Method Library (Shared)

BMAD (Build-Measure-Automate-Deploy) guides our agent-assisted delivery practice. This folder now houses the shared playbooks:

- `core-architecture.md`, `GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md`, `user-guide.md`, etc. – philosophy, structure, and IDE workflows that apply to every team.

Portal-specific supplements live beside their product docs:

| Scope | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Partnerships | `docs/partners/bmad/` |
| Client base | `docs/client/bmad/` |

When you evolve BMAD, update the relevant scope folder and note major changes in these guides so teams stay aligned.

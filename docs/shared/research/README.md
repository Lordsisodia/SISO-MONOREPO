# Shared Research & Patterns

Centralize insights that improve both portals:

- `patterns/` – reusable UX/content/engineering patterns validated across products.
- `insights/` – add dated research batches here as we publish more cross-portal studies.
- `assets/` – shared storytelling artifacts (presentations, PDFs, imagery) that don't belong to a single portal.

Client- or partner-only findings should stay inside their respective folders and reference this space only if/when they graduate to shared guidance.
